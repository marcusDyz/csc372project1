READEME for project 1 

We did 2 Go language program one shows the typical syntax and functionality of Go language.
Another one shows the special function in Go language called "goroutine"

In the cryptogram.go, you can see several typical go syntax including assigning variable, struct, 
built-in data structure like map, and unique if statement thatis different from other popular languages

The Go language syntax is a little similar to Java, however, Go language does not have exception, 
it uses error which is easy to see which function return errors and to handle them.
Error is a built-in interface that can be used by programmers efficiently.

For the cryptogram.go file, please run this file in terminal and avoid to run it in an IDE, because 
running it in an IDE, the function os.Getwd() in readFile() will read the current path of IDE instead of
the cryptogram.go file, which will failed to read the quotes.txt file and throws an error.

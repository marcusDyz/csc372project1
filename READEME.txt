We did 2 Go language program one shows the typical syntax and functionality of Go language.
Another one shows the special function in Go language called "goroutine"

In the cryptogram.go, you can see several typical go syntax including assigning variable, struct, 
built-in data structure like map, and unique if statement thatis different from other popular languages

The Go language syntax is a little similar to Java, however, Go language does not have exception, 
it uses error which is easy to see which function return errors and to handle them.
Error is a built-in interface that can be used by programmers efficiently.

For the cryptogram.go file, please run this file in terminal and avoid to run it in an IDE, because 
running it in an IDE, the function os.Getwd() in readFile() will read the current path of IDE instead of
the cryptogram.go file, which will failed to read the quotes.txt file and throws an error.

The second file goroutine.go shows the two of the most important special feature of Go language,
Goroutine and Channel. Goroutine is similar to thread in other language, but the cost of Goroutine is less 
than a regular thread. In a Go program, main function is the main goroutine, programmers can use the 
keyword "go" to create a sub goroutine that does other work one's expected.
If goroutines are the activities of a concurrent Go program, channels are the connections between them.
Channel allows one goroutine send value(data) to other goroutines.
